# GitHub Collaboration and Version Control Application (GitDemo)

Welcome to our GitHub Collaboration and Version Control Application project! This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with fundamental concepts of Git version control and collaboration, while also incorporating encryption techniques using RSA methods.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to help users understand the workflow of version control systems like Git and learn about collaborative development practices. Additionally, it introduces encryption principles through RSA encryption, offering a practical application of cryptographic techniques.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can enter their personal GitHub account information securely within the application.
- **Key Generation**: The application generates a public key for the user, which they commit and push to the project repository.
- **Encryption**: The public key is used to encrypt sensitive information (e.g., user credentials) before sending it over the network.
- **Decryption**: The project owner, possessing the private key, can decrypt the encrypted information.
- **Email Notification**: Upon successful decryption, the user receives a success image sent to their email.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Rennsen/Git-Demo.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. You can find these listed in the project's documentation.

3. **Set Up Your GitHub Account**: Open the application and enter your GitHub account information as prompted.

4. **Generate and Commit Your Public Key**: The application will generate a public key for you. Commit and push this key to the project repository.

5. **Encryption and Decryption**: After pushing your public key, the project owner will decrypt the information encrypted with your public key.

6. **Email Notification**: Upon successful decryption, you will receive a success image sent to your email address.
